pros:
  - "Autonomous execution — delegates entire tasks, not just completions"
  - "Full shell access — can run tests, check git, install packages"
  - "CLAUDE.md project memory persists across sessions"
  - "Claude Opus is the strongest coding model available"
  - "Handles complex multi-file refactors better than any GUI tool"
cons:
  - "Terminal-only — no visual diff or inline suggestions"
  - "Steep learning curve — you need to learn how to prompt effectively"

## What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line interface for coding with Claude. No IDE, no extensions, no GUI — just your terminal and the most powerful coding AI available.

You run `claude` in your project directory, describe what you want, and it *does it*. Not "suggests it" — actually reads files, writes code, runs commands, checks results, and iterates until the task is done.

It sounds like a gimmick. It's not. After three months of daily use, Claude Code has fundamentally changed how we work.

## The Setup (5 Minutes)

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Authenticate (needs Max subscription or API key)
claude auth

# Start working
cd your-project
claude
```

That's it. There's one more step that makes a huge difference: create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root.

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Project: My API Server
- Language: TypeScript, Node.js 22
- Framework: Express with Zod validation
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma
- Tests: Vitest, run with `npm test`
- Style: Functional, no classes, prefer const
- Error handling: Always use Result types, never throw
```

Claude reads this file at the start of every session. It's like giving a new team member the project README, coding standards, and architecture docs all at once. Over time, you refine it, and Claude gets better and better at matching your project's conventions.

## What Makes It Different

### It's Autonomous, Not Assistive

Other AI coding tools wait for you to accept suggestions line by line. Claude Code takes a task and runs with it:

```
You: Add pagination to the /users endpoint. Use cursor-based pagination, 
     not offset. Update the tests.

Claude Code: [reads route file] [reads Prisma schema] [reads existing tests]
             [writes pagination utility] [updates route] [updates 3 test files]
             [runs npm test] [fixes one failing test] [runs again] [all pass]
             
Done. Modified 5 files, all tests passing.
```

This is fundamentally different from tab-completing one line at a time. You're delegating, not dictating. For experienced developers who know what they want but don't want to type it all out, this is transformative.

### It Has Full System Access

Claude Code runs in your terminal with your permissions. It can:

- Read any file in your project
- Write and modify files
- Run shell commands (`npm test`, `git diff`, `curl`)
- Check environment variables
- Install packages

This means it can verify its own work. When it writes code, it can run the tests to check if they pass. When it modifies a config, it can restart the service to see if it works. This self-verification loop dramatically reduces the "AI wrote something that looks right but doesn't work" problem.

### CLAUDE.md Is Quietly Brilliant

The `CLAUDE.md` convention is simple — just a markdown file — but it solves a problem that plagues every other AI tool: **context persistence.**

Cursor re-indexes your project but doesn't remember *how you want things done*. Copilot learns from your file but forgets across sessions. Claude Code reads your CLAUDE.md every time and consistently follows your conventions.

We've seen our CLAUDE.md grow from 10 lines to 50 over three months. It now includes:
- Code style preferences
- Common pitfalls ("never use `any` in TypeScript")
- Project-specific terminology
- How to run different test suites
- Deployment procedures

The more you invest in CLAUDE.md, the more Claude Code feels like a team member who's been on the project for months.

## Real Performance Data

We tracked Claude Code's performance over 100 tasks across three projects:

| Task Type | Success Rate | Avg Time | Manual Cleanup Needed |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Bug fixes | 82% | 3 min | Minor (5/100 tasks) |
| New features | 71% | 8 min | Moderate (15/100) |
| Refactoring | 88% | 6 min | Minor (8/100) |
| Test writing | 90% | 4 min | Rare (3/100) |
| Complex architecture changes | 55% | 15 min | Often (25/100) |

**Overall: 77% of tasks completed with no or minor manual cleanup.** That's remarkable for fully autonomous execution.

The sweet spot is medium-complexity tasks: adding features, writing tests, refactoring modules. For these, Claude Code is faster than doing it yourself about 80% of the time.

Where it struggles: highly creative architectural decisions and deeply ambiguous requirements. That's expected — those tasks are hard for human developers too.

## The Learning Curve

Let's be honest: Claude Code has a steeper learning curve than Cursor or Copilot. Things that trip up new users:

1. **Prompting style matters.** Vague instructions get vague results. "Make the code better" → bad. "Add error handling to the payment flow — use the existing ErrorResult type pattern from auth.ts" → good.

2. **When to intervene.** Sometimes Claude Code goes down the wrong path. Learning when to interrupt ("stop — wrong approach, try X instead") vs. letting it iterate is a skill.

3. **Token awareness.** Complex tasks can use 50K-100K tokens. On the Max plan, this is usually fine. On API credits, it adds up. You learn to break big tasks into smaller pieces.

4. **Trust calibration.** Early on, you'll want to review every change manually. Over time, you learn which tasks Claude handles flawlessly (test writing, straightforward refactors) and which need careful review (database migrations, auth changes).

Most developers need about 2 weeks to become productive with Claude Code. After a month, you'll wonder how you coded without it.

## Pricing

Claude Code requires either:

- **Anthropic Max subscription ($20/mo):** Generous token limits, access to Opus and Sonnet
- **API credits:** Pay-as-you-go, approximately $15/M input tokens and $75/M output tokens for Opus

For individual developers, the Max subscription is the better deal. Heavy users (10+ complex tasks/day) might want API credits for more control.

There's no free tier. This is a real barrier to adoption. We'd love to see a limited free option — even 10 tasks/day would let developers try it.

## The Verdict: 9/10

Claude Code is the best AI coding tool we've used — period. The autonomous execution model is genuinely more productive than the suggestion-based approach of Cursor and Copilot for complex work.

We dock one point for:
- No free tier
- Terminal-only (a lightweight web UI would help adoption)
- Token consumption can be surprising

But for developers who write serious code — backend systems, APIs, data pipelines, infrastructure — Claude Code is the tool to beat in 2026.

**The bottom line:** If you're spending most of your time on complex, multi-file work and you're comfortable in the terminal, Claude Code will make you significantly faster. If you mostly need autocomplete for frontend components, stick with Cursor or Copilot.
