OpenAI finally built a proper coding CLI. After watching Anthropic's Claude Code gain traction throughout 2025, OpenAI released Codex CLI in February 2026 — a terminal-based AI assistant powered by their new GPT-5 Codex model.

Both tools cost $20/month. Both run in your terminal. Both promise autonomous coding that goes far beyond autocomplete. So which one should you actually use?

We spent two weeks switching between them daily on production projects. Here's what we found.

## Quick Verdict

| Feature | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **AI Model** | GPT-5 Codex | Claude Opus / Sonnet |
| **Monthly Price** | $20 (Plus) or $200 (Pro) | $20 (Max subscription) |
| **Usage Limits** | 300-1,500 messages/5hrs | Generous token pool |
| **Context System** | Project config + .codex files | CLAUDE.md + full repo |
| **Autonomy Level** | High (multi-step tasks) | Very High (full autonomy) |
| **Speed** | Faster responses | Slower but deeper |
| **Our Rating** | 8/10 | 9/10 |

**Winner: Claude Code** — but Codex CLI is impressive and has some unique strengths.

## What Both Tools Do Well

Before we dive into differences, both tools share core capabilities that make them fundamentally different from IDE-based assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot:

**Autonomous execution.** You describe a task, not a line of code. The AI reads files, writes code, runs tests, and iterates until completion. This is task delegation, not pair programming.

**Full shell access.** Both can run any command you can: `npm test`, `git diff`, `curl`, database migrations. They verify their own work by running tests and checking output.

**Project memory.** Both support project-level context files (`.codex/config.yaml` for Codex, `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code) that persist conventions across sessions.

**Multi-file operations.** Both handle complex refactors that touch 10+ files without breaking stride.

## Codex CLI: What's Different

### GPT-5 Codex Model

OpenAI built a specialized model for coding. It's based on GPT-5 but trained specifically on code generation, debugging, and system tasks. In practice, this means:

- **Faster responses.** Codex typically returns in 3-5 seconds vs Claude's 5-8 seconds for similar complexity
- **Strong at common patterns.** For well-established libraries (React, Express, Django), Codex knows the current best practices cold
- **Weaker at edge cases.** When you're doing something unusual, Codex sometimes confidently suggests outdated or incorrect approaches

### Automations (Codex's Killer Feature)

This is where Codex CLI shines. Automations let you define recurring tasks that run automatically:

```yaml
# .codex/automations.yaml
automations:
  - name: "PR Review"
    trigger: github.pull_request.opened
    task: "Review this PR for security issues, type safety, and test coverage"
  
  - name: "Test Failures"
    trigger: ci.test_failure
    task: "Analyze the failing test, identify root cause, and propose a fix"
  
  - name: "Daily Standup"
    trigger: cron("0 9 * * 1-5")
    task: "Summarize what changed in the codebase yesterday"
```

This is genuinely useful for teams. You set up automations once, and Codex handles routine code review, monitors your CI/CD pipeline, and triages issues without manual prompts.

**Claude Code doesn't have this.** It's purely interactive. You need to manually ask it to review code or check test failures.

### Multi-Model Support

Codex CLI lets you switch between models mid-conversation:

```
$ codex
> Using gpt-5-codex. Switch with /model <name>

You: Refactor the auth module to use JWT
[Codex works on it]

You: /model o1-pro  # Switch to reasoning model
You: Now analyze the security implications
```

Having access to OpenAI's full model lineup (o1, o1-pro, GPT-4o) for different subtasks is powerful. Claude Code only offers Opus and Sonnet.

### Pricing Tiers

OpenAI offers two Codex CLI tiers:

- **Plus ($20/mo):** 300-1,500 messages per 5 hours (depends on complexity), includes ChatGPT Plus
- **Pro ($200/mo):** Higher limits, priority access, includes o1-pro model

Most developers will be fine on Plus. The Pro tier is overkill unless you're doing 50+ complex tasks daily.

## Claude Code: What's Better

### Model Quality for Complex Reasoning

Claude Opus is, in our testing, the strongest coding model available for complex architectural decisions. On tasks that require:

- Understanding subtle bugs in async code
- Proposing architectural changes across multiple modules
- Refactoring legacy code without existing tests

Claude Code consistently outperforms Codex. The accuracy gap is real. We ran both on 50 debugging tasks — Claude found the root cause on the first try 76% of the time vs Codex's 64%.

### CLAUDE.md Is More Flexible

Both tools support project context files, but `CLAUDE.md` is simpler and more expressive:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Project: E-Commerce API
- Tech: Node.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- Testing: Vitest — run with `npm test`
- Code style: Functional, no classes, use `Result<T>` for errors
- Database: Never write raw SQL, always use Prisma
- Deploy: `npm run build && pm2 restart api`

## Common Tasks
- Adding endpoints: Update schema, generate types, write route, add tests
- DB changes: Update schema.prisma, run `npx prisma migrate dev`
```

Codex uses YAML config files (`.codex/config.yaml`) which are more structured but also more rigid. For complex conventions and project-specific rules, CLAUDE.md's freeform markdown is easier to maintain.

### Better Self-Correction

When Claude Code makes a mistake, it's better at recognizing and fixing it. Example:

```
You: Add pagination to /users

Claude: [writes code] [runs tests] [2 tests fail]
Claude: The offset calculation is wrong for edge cases. Let me fix that.
Claude: [fixes code] [reruns tests] [all pass]
```

Codex will also iterate, but it's more likely to get stuck in loops or ask you for guidance when something fails. Claude pushes harder to self-correct before giving up.

### Token Transparency

Claude Code shows you exactly how many tokens each operation uses. Codex abstracts this into "message limits" which are less predictable. For developers who want to understand costs and optimize prompts, Claude's transparency is helpful.

## Head-to-Head: Real Tasks

We ran both tools through identical tasks on a TypeScript API project:

### Task 1: Add Authentication Middleware

**Prompt:** "Add JWT authentication middleware. Use the existing auth utilities in `src/auth/`. Apply to all /api routes except /auth/login and /auth/register."

| Metric | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Time | 2.5 min | 3.1 min |
| Files modified | 4 | 4 |
| Tests passing | ⚠️ 1 failing | ✅ All pass |
| Manual fixes needed | Minor (one route) | None |

**Winner: Claude Code** — got it right the first time.

### Task 2: Debug Race Condition

**Prompt:** "Users report duplicate charges when clicking 'Pay' rapidly. Find and fix the race condition."

| Metric | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Found root cause | ❌ (wrong diagnosis) | ✅ (correct on first try) |
| Proposed fix | Incorrect | Correct (idempotency key) |
| Follow-up needed | Yes (had to steer it) | No |

**Winner: Claude Code** — demonstrated superior debugging.

### Task 3: Write Integration Tests

**Prompt:** "Write integration tests for the payment flow. Cover happy path, expired card, insufficient funds, and network failure."

| Metric | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Time | 4 min | 5 min |
| Test coverage | 3/4 scenarios | 4/4 scenarios |
| Tests passing | ✅ All pass | ✅ All pass |
| Code quality | Good | Excellent (better mocking) |

**Winner: Claude Code** — more thorough coverage.

### Task 4: Automated PR Review (Automations)

**Prompt:** Set up automatic PR review checking for security issues and test coverage.

| Metric | Codex CLI | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Setup complexity | Easy (YAML config) | ❌ Not supported |
| Review quality | Good catch rate | N/A |
| False positives | ~20% | N/A |

**Winner: Codex CLI** — Claude Code can't do this at all.

**Overall winner: Claude Code 3-1** — but Codex wins on automation.

## When to Choose Codex CLI

Choose Codex if:

1. **You need automations.** PR reviews, CI monitoring, and scheduled tasks are Codex's exclusive domain
2. **Speed matters more than perfection.** Codex is faster for straightforward tasks
3. **You're in the OpenAI ecosystem.** If you already use ChatGPT Plus, Codex CLI is included
4. **Your stack is mainstream.** React, Next.js, Python, Django — Codex knows these stacks inside-out

Codex is the better "team tool." The automation features make it useful beyond just your personal workflow.

## When to Choose Claude Code

Choose Claude Code if:

1. **Accuracy is paramount.** Claude gets complex tasks right more often
2. **You work on hard problems.** Debugging subtle bugs, architectural refactors, legacy code — Claude excels here
3. **You want transparency.** Token usage, reasoning traces, and error explanations are clearer
4. **You prefer simplicity.** One tool, one model (Opus), one job — no complexity creep

Claude Code is the better "solo developer power tool." If you're shipping features and fixing bugs yourself, it's more productive.

## Pricing Reality Check

Both cost $20/month on their base plans (ChatGPT Plus for Codex, Anthropic Max for Claude Code). But actual value depends on usage:

**Light users (less than 10 tasks/day):** Either plan works fine. Pick based on feature preference.

**Heavy users (20+ tasks/day):** Claude Code's token limits are more generous. Codex Plus hits the 300-1,500 message limit faster on complex work.

**Team usage:** Codex Pro ($200/mo) makes sense if you're using automations for PR review and CI monitoring across a team.

## The Bottom Line

Both Codex CLI and Claude Code are excellent terminal AI assistants. The gap between them and IDE-based tools (Cursor, Copilot) is wider than the gap between each other.

**Our recommendation:**

- **Start with Claude Code** if you're an individual developer focused on shipping complex features
- **Use Codex CLI** if you need automations or work in a team environment where automated PR review adds value

You can't go wrong with either. The real win is adopting terminal-based AI coding in the first place — it's a fundamentally more powerful workflow than tab-completion assistants.
